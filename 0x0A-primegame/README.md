Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from `1` up to and including `n`, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

*   Prototype: `def isWinner(x, nums)`
*   where `x` is the number of rounds and `nums` is an array of `n`
*   Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
*   If the winner cannot be determined, return `None`
*   You can assume `n` and `x` will not be larger than 10000
*   You cannot import any packages in this task

Example:

*   `x` \= `3`, `nums` \= `[4, 5, 1]`

First round: `4`

*   Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3
*   Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1
*   Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose

Second round: `5`

*   Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3, 5
*   Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1, 5
*   Maria picks 5 and removes 5, leaving 1
*   Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose

Third round: `1`

*   Ben wins because there are no prime numbers for Maria to choose

**Result: Ben has the most wins**
